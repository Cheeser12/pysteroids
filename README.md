Pysteroids
==========

**Pysteroids** is an Asteroids clone written in Python and using the
[Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org "Pyglet") multimedia library.
All of the graphics are done via OpenGL calls exposed by Pyglet,
no images are used. I wanted to capture the 'retro' feel of playing
Asteroids on Atari or Intellivision or whatever, as well as practice
applying some mathematics to programming (mostly in the form of linear
algebra and the separating axis theorem). All of the sounds were created
using [SFXR](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html "SFXR").

Essentially all of the code is written by me, but I might've adapted some sample code
for collision and such, because math is really hard.
